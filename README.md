Image search abstraction layer
==============================

How to use
----------
A service for making image searches. Search for an image and you will be shown ten results. You can also choose when to start searching.

To make a search, visit `https://matts-img-search.glitch.me/api/imagesearch/<searchterm>`, where `<searchterm>` is the term for the image you are searching.

You can also choose either to paginate through results by specifying an offset, or you can choose the index to start the search from.

To set the offset, you use `https://matts-img-search.glitch.me/api/imagesearch/cat?offset=2`

To start at a certain index, you use `https://matts-img-search.glitch.me/api/imagesearch/cat?start=11`

(Both searches will reveal the same results, because there are ten results displayed per page and the index starts at 1)

You can set an offset between 1 and 9 and start a search between 1 and 90 (Google's custom search API gives you the first 100 results free).

View the last ten searches and when they happened by visiting `https://matts-img-search.glitch.me/api/latest/imagesearch`.
